# ConnectFour
Console implementation of the game Connect Four in C

## Setup & Run

```sh
cmake -H. -Bbuild [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug]
make -C build -j
./build/src/main/main
[./build/src/main/utest]
rm -rf build
```

Or with bash scripts:
```shell
./cmake.sh [Debug]
./main.sh
[./test.sh]
./clean.sh
```

(Give permissions to the script files) <br>
(Commands in "[ ]" are optional)

If you want to run the scripts without "./" you can even add current directory to the PATH:
```shell
export PATH="$PATH:."
```

## Configurations

If the TOKEN "â¬¤" is wider than your ascii characters, you can replace it with "O" in the board.h header.
